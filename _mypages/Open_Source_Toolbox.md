The basic idea is to talk a bit about the way scientists in the life sciences, more specifically in the field
of Biological Sciences, can profit from the use of open source software.

## What this means for my work 

### Starting from the design of this web site...
- Specifically, *Emacs* was used as the main text editor, in particular, *Emacs* *org* mode. 
- I often also use the very powerful and flexible *TextMate* editor (unfortunately available only for Mac OSX).
- The *org* mode files can be converted into Markdown files (which is
  the format required by *Jekyll*). *Jekyll* is the engine behind the generation of these web pages.
- *Jekyll* runs under the *Ruby* language environment.

### ...to managing bibliography...
- Bibliographical research and bibliography collections are handled using *Zotero*.

### ...all the way to data management and analysis...
- All of the modelling, data handling, analysis and statistics are done using *R*.

### ...modelling, graphical simulation...
- Simulations and graphical modelling are done using *Processing*.

### ...and not forgetting image manipulation and vectorialized drawing...
- In which case the open source packages *GIMP* and *Inkscape* are just great!
- Also *ImageJ (Fiji)* is a very powerful package for image processing and
  analysis, specifically designed for microscopy imaging applications.
