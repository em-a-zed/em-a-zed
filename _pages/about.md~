# Normally would use the comand below to include a toc
# But this doesn't allow to exclude specific headers from toc
# toc: true

<!---
Put this Liquid inclusion of toc {% include toc %}, instead of the YAML code above
Because in this way you can then exclude specific headers from
inclusion in the final table of contents by using 
{:.no_toc} under the heading to exclude desired headers
as in the case of the following two headers...
-->
{% include toc %}

### In brief
{:.no_toc}
* I was born in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) on the
  12th November 1958.
* In 1976, I completed my secondary school education (A levels) at
  Prince Edward High School (Salisbury, Rhodesia) in the subjects of
  Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics.
* In 1983 I graduated in Biology at the University of Padova, Italy,
  following the presentation of a thesis entitled: "Protein
  polymorphism at the *esterase-6* locus in *Drosophila
  melanogaster*".
* In 1989 I obtained a PhD in Evolutionary Biology at the University
  of Padova, Italy.
* In 1990, I became a Researcher in Genetics, Department of Biology,
  Scoolf of Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.
* Since 2002 my position is Associate Professor in Genetics, Department of
  Biology, School of Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.

### Teaching activity 
Genetics, Population Genetics, Programming in R (Applied Statistics).

I am currently responsible for the ERASMUS International Student
Exchange program for the Department of Biology, and within this
framework I am actively involved in maintaining a Double Diploma
program between our University and the University of Paris VII
(France), for the Master's degree in Molecular Biology and the
Master's degree in Genetics (Magistére en Génétique), respectively.

### Research Interests
I have been involved in research aimed at understanding the adaptive
meaning of the molecular machinery implicated in the generation and
maintenance of biological circadian rhythms in *Drosophila
melanogaster* as well as other insects. In this context I developed
most of my experience in conducting behavioural analyses with the
objective of establishing the presence of locomotor defects, as well
as alterations in integrative neuronal functions, such as those
involved in the response to visual and/or olfactory stimuli.

#### In this respect:
{:.no_toc}
I have participated in research in which *Drosophila melanogaster* was
used as a model to study genes involved in human hereditary
neuromuscular and/or mitochondrial diseases.  I have been involved in
a collaborative research project in which the Drosophila larval
neuromuscular junction was used as a model chemical synapse
(glutamatergic) in which to study the detailed interplay between
proteins and membrane lipids (among which the sphingolipids) in the
process of neuronal vesicle recycling.  Currently, my main interest
rests in the use of Drosophila as a model of neuropsychiatric
disease. The complex constellation of behavioural phenotypes involved
in neuropsychiatric disorders and the largely familiar pattern of
inheritance, which is of a complex genetic nature, are the main
reasons why so little is known of the pathogenesis of these diseases.
Flies allow experimental approaches which are still difficult to
address in other vertebrate model organisms, with particular reference
to the sophisticated genetics and a very powerful toolbox of
transgenic methods for neuronal circuit analysis.  In addition,
Drosophila has a relatively complex nervous system which shares many
fundamental cellular and neurobiological processes with that of
humans.

Altogether the common denominator of my ongoing research activity
entails the use of *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model to study the
genetics of behavioural, neuromuscular and synaptic defects which have
some relation to known human hereditary diseases.
