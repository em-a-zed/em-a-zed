Although I am an Emacs fan, I do realize that Emacs is not the only
tool for certain tasks. In particular, scripting for R can be done in
many open source ways.

# I personally use two of these: Emacs and RStudio.

I have already spoken of Emacs, in particular of the Emacs Speaks
Statistics project ([ESS](https://ess.r-project.org)), which
provides for an out-of-the-box R-ready version of Emacs. The big
advantage of this solution is that I can switch from one task to the
other (i.e. write a post, a research paper, an R script, edit my web
site files, or produce slides for my lessons), all the time remaining
comfortably within the same editing environment. 

An unbiased view of scripting environments for working with R cannot
ignore other valid solutions. In particular, one of the most powerful
and increasingly popular open source tools is the
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) package. RStudio is actually much
more than a scripting editor for R. Citing the description given by
the developers: "/RStudio is an integrated development environment
(IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that
supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting,
history, debugging and workspace management/". Not only, RStudio also
provides on-board tools for authoring HTML, PDF, Word Documents, and
slide shows. Admittedly a pretty impressive package. In addition,
RStudio's GUI is based upon R-dedicated icon and drop-down menus,
which is the main reason why I generally introduce R to beginners
using RStudio as the script editor.

[Textmate](https://macromates.com) is another open source option
worth considering in this context. It is, as the name implies, a text
editor which can be customized to work with a large number of
scripting and programming languages, including R of course. In this
respect Textmate provides a comfortable R scripting environment with a
lot of the R functionality, when in R mode, present as pull-down menu
options. The only 'limit' is that Textmate is available only for
MacOSX.

Yet another, cross-platform, powerful, open source text editor is
[atom](https://atom.io). Defined as: "*A hackable text editor for
the 21st Century*" this has become a favourite among many
developers. I personally don't use Atom, but only because, at a
certain point, I decided to commit to some tools, not really having
the time to fully explore the potential of all the available options.
