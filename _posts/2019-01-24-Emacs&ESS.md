In the Docs section of this web site I spoke, in a rather general
way, about the use I make of Open Source Software. 
I wanted to add to those considerations, with
particular reference to *Emacs*. 

<!--more-->

The original *GNU* version of *Emacs* is perfect for most uses,
however, when it comes to using *Emacs* as your editor for *R*, it is
not easy to configure *Emacs* for this task. Fortunately someone has
come to the rescue on this issue by providing a customized version of
*Emacs* which is packaged specifically to solve this problem (by
adding in the **Emacs Speaks Statistics** package and bundling it with
*GNU Emacs*). The ESS package has a much wider scope than just
providing a scripting interface for *R*, it was designed to provide a
scripting interface for other commercial Statistics packages too (among other
things) such as, S-Plus, SAS and Stata.
All you have to do, then, is to head over to the 
<a href="https://ess.r-project.org">**ESS**</a> web site
and get hold of the **Emacs Speaks Statistics** version of *Emacs*.
This way you will have all the power of *Emacs* with the added
benefits provided by the ESS package.
